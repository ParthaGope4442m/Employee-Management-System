# Employee Management System

A lightweight React-based authentication demo featuring two roles—**admin** and **employee**—and separate dashboards for each. Ideal as a starter template for learning or prototyping role-based access control.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Role-based login with hardcoded credentials:
  - **Admin:** `admin@me.com` / `123`
  - **Employee:** any email/password matching `Authcontext.employees`
- Conditional rendering of dashboards:
  - Shows only **Login**, **EmployeeDashboard**, or **AdminDashboard** based on user role
- Simple and extendable architecture:
  - Swap the hardcoded logic for real API-based or JWT authentication

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Login flow**: `App` component uses `handleLogin` to set the `user` state to `'admin'`, `'employee'`, or `null`.
2. **Conditional rendering**:
   ```jsx
   {!user && <Login handleLogin={handleLogin}/>}
   {user === 'employee' && <EmployeeDashboard/>}
   {user === 'admin' && <AdminDashboard/>}
````

3. **Extendable logic**: Simply replace the inline `handleLogin` credentials or employee list with real backend endpoints or JWT flows.

## 🧪 Enhancements & Customization

* 🔐 Connect to a backend with email/password hashing or OAuth
* 📌 Persist login using `localStorage` or cookies
* 🚦 Add role-based routing with React Router
* 🚨 Display error messages on failed logins
* 🧩 Use Context or Redux for global auth state
* 🧪 Write tests to safeguard logic and UI flow
